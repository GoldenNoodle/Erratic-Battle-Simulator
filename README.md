Erratic Battle Simulator

A single player third person arena fighter set in a gladiator's arena. The player will control a gladiator character to fight other NPCs in a dynamically changing arena. The last person standing is declared the winner!
However, one of the main game mechanics is the periodic weapon switch which causes the player to recieve new weapons at a 30 second interval. Weapons can range from a powerful sword to a flimsy pool noodle.
Never let your guard down as battle can turn for the worst at any moment. Run, Fight, and Climb your way to victory as you navigate through a floor shifting arena with giant boulders and columns in your way. 
This arena also has a special surprise itself... the floor will crumble away at a set period causing the field to be smaller and smaller as lava awaits for you if you fall...
Can you stand atop the rest and become the last man standing?
