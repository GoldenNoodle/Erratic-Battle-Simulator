Collaboration Notes:
1) Accept role as collaborator from email so you can see Repository for the game
2) Download the GitHub Desktop App
3) In the Desktop App, click File -> Clone Repository and click on the one that I made available for you guys when you accepted to be a collaborator 
4) Now in Unity Hub you can add the game and start working on it. It should sync with the GitHub. 
5) After making edits to the game, go inside your GitHub Desktop App and click the "commit to main button" to update the github so that everyone else call request a pull and see the changes you made
